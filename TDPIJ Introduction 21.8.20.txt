Test Driven Programming in java

	Here in this module we are going to write java code
	and later test it using some junit codes.
	
	There are different type of testing:

	1) Black Box Testing
		Black box testers are the software tester who
		use softwares to test entire application.
	
		They are not testing each line of a code/statement.
		They are testing overall functionality of an app.

		1) System Testing
		2) Regression Testing
		3) Performance Testing
		4) Acceptance Testing


	2) White Box Testing

		In White box testing we should have good knowledge of
		coding.
		Here we test each statement/module of an app.
		White box is also known as glass box testing.

		1) Unit Testing
		2) Integration Testing
		3) Regression Testing
		4) Performance Testing



	Test overall software functionality
		Check whole software
		
	Test code (modules)
		Check whether your function or whole
		file is working properly or not.

	Debugging 
		Check your code line by line to find error
		or to understand the code.


	

	STLC (Software Testing Life Cycle)
	
	1) Requirement Analysis
	2) Test Planning
	3) Test Environment Setup
	4) Test case development
	5) Test Execution	
		FixError
	6) Test Closure
